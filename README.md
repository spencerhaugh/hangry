# Hangry!

Welcome to Hangry! This is version 2.0 of the project I first created as a software engineering bootcamp student in 2020. I was very happy with it at the time, but since then as I have continued to build my skills, I thought it would be fun to revist this project and apply this experience.

Boy. Looking back at this app's original codebase was a journey. I remember the struggle, and the frustration. I built this app originally in Vue (it was a project requirement to use a technology that was new to us), but for v2 I am using React. At my day job these days I am building with Angular, and I wanted to stay sharp in React as well.

### What is it?

Hangry is an app that talks to a 3rd party API to gather and return a random recipe, and display parts of this daa to the user, including an image, meal facts, and a link to the source of the recipe.

I built this app with React, and implemented Material UI components for styling.

I would like to continue to add to this project by adding login and accounts for users to store any favorite recipes they find.

A stretch goal would be to add in funtionality to allow users to restrict what recipes were returned from the API by ingredients they had available to use.

###
